                                            create library archives and use external libraries.

EX00:                   Packages
Code can be organized on different levels. Packages are one of the code organization
          methods where classes are located in individual folders.

Read an image file into memory:
    -reading an image file into memory is about transferring its contents into a fast-access area (RAM)
    where your program can work with the image efficiently and perform various operations without the slow
    read/write speeds associated with disk storage.

BufferedImage:
    -A subclass of Image used to handle and manipulate images loaded into memory in Java.
    The image content is stored in a way that allows direct access to the image data, pixels each with its own set of color values.

ImageIO.read(new File(filePath)):
    This method is used for reading an image from a file

EX01:                   JAR (Java ARchive)
A JAR (Java ARchive) file is a package file format typically used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata
and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution, It's used for several purposes, such as packaging programs
(applications) and libraries, so they can be easily distributed and used, making the application more portable

the JAR file i need to create is referred to as images-to-chars-printer.jar.

This JAR will include not only the compiled .class files but also the resources such as the image.bmp I'm supposed to display.

Manifest File:
The manifest file in a Java Archive (JAR) is a special file that contains information about the files packaged in the JAR, The primary
purpose of the manifest is to define the entry point for the application and to package metadata in the form of name-value pairs.

By using Logic.class.getResource(), you're effectively saying, "Start looking for the resource in the classpath from the location of the Logic class."

After creating the JAR, check the structure inside the JAR file to make sure that the class files are properly placed according to their package structure.
 You can view the contents of the JAR file using: >>>: jar tf ./target/images-to-chars-printer.jar

ex02:                   JCommander & JCDP
you're expected to enhance your Java project by integrating external libraries for command-line processing and colored console output.
.The use JCommander to handle command-line options.
.either JCDP (Java Colored Debug Printer) or JColor for colored text output.

-To use JCommander to handle command-line arguments in your Java application, you first need to add the JCommander library
  to your project and make sure the JCommander JAR file is in your lib directory and included in your classpath
-Add a Command Class: This class will hold the values of the command-line arguments.

By default, JCommander uses both spaces and equals signs as separators between parameter names and their values.
so it's okay not to specify the @Parameters(separators = "=") in the Args class

">>In our case, the classpath would typically include the directory where your compiled .class files reside(e.g., the target/ directory
you might be compiling your classes into) along with any directories or JAR files that contain libraries required by your program

Including JAR files in your classpath is essential because Java uses the classpath as a lookup path to find classes
and resources necessary to run your program.

When you specify these directories in the classpath, Java knows to look in these locations to find the classes and libraries
necessary to run your application.<<"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Java's package structure:
        By copying Program.Class from target/printer/app/Program.class to the ImagesToChar directory,
        you disrupted the package structure that Java expects.

    The -cp option stands for "classpath" to search for class files. This means Java will look in the target directory
    (and its subdirectories, following the package structure) to find the required classes to run the program.
        printer.app.Program
        This is the fully qualified name of the main class to be executed

    The prefix java in Java package names is typically reserved for standard Java packages and classes provided by the
    Java platform itself.

    src/ is often set as the root of the classpath.
