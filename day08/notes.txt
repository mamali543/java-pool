Loosely-Coupled Systems
A loosely-coupled system is one where components are independent of each other and don't depend on specific implementations.
Instead, they depend on abstractions or interfaces.

These three components form the core of our banking system. They are loosely coupled because:
Each component depends on interfaces rather than concrete implementations.
They don't know about the internal workings of other components.
We can swap out implementations of these components without affecting the others.
