threads and processes: real-time-processing
    -a process can have different threads so when u try to print the process id of different threads you'll get the same process id!
    -threads share memory and all the system resources, while processes duplicate them.
    -Threads that are awakened by notifyAll() will move from the waiting state to the blocked state.
    -synchronized keyword meaning that only one thread can execute a synchronized block or method at a time.

    -Any section of code that manipulates shared resources or critical data is called a critical section. The synchronized keyword ensures
     that only one thread at a time can enter a critical section. Without synchronized, even if you use notify() or notifyAll(),
     there's no guarantee that the operations within those wait/notify blocks are safe from concurrent modifications.

     -In Java, every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it. When a method is declared as synchronized,
      it requires any thread that calls the method to first acquire this intrinsic lock before it can execute the method.

      -As soon as a thread enters the print(String msg) method, it acquires the intrinsic lock associated with the Store instance
       on which it was invoked.This happens automatically because the method is declared as synchronized.

Disadvantage of using single-threaded approach:
      -Performance: On a multicore processor, the single-threaded approach does not take full advantage of hardware capabilities.
       The entire computation is done on a single core, leaving other cores idle, which can be inefficient especially
       with large arrays or computationally intensive tasks.

Solving the Problem Using Multiple Threads (Multithreading)
      -Using multithreading, you can divide the array into several segments, with each thread responsible for summing one segment.
       This parallelizes the workload across multiple cores, potentially speeding up the computation.

Synchronization of Completion:
      -By using join(), you ensure that all threads have completed their tasks before the main thread
