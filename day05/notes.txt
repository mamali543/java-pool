                                                SQL & JDBC

The JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) Driver is a set of Java interfaces and classes that allow Java applications
to interact with a database. It serves as a bridge between a database and Java programs, enabling you to execute SQL queries,
retrieve data, and update records without needing to embed database-specific code in your Java programs

Data Access Object (DAO, Repository) is a popular design pattern that allows to
separate key business logic from data handling logic in an application.
Letâ€™s assume that we have an interface called CoursesRepository which provides
access to course lessons. This interface may look as follows:
        public interface CoursesRepository {
        Optional<Course> findById(Long id);
        void delete(Course course);
        void save(Course course);
        void update(Course course);
        List<Course> findAll();
        }
