why we need a separet thread for the client?

Example Workflow:

Client 1 connects to the server.
Server's ClientHandler thread handles communication with Client 1.
Client 1's main thread is waiting for input from the user (e.g., "Enter a message:").
Client 1's separate thread listens for incoming messages from the server. If Client 2 sends a message to the server, the server broadcasts it, and Client 1â€™s listening thread will print the message as soon as it receives it from the server.
Client 1 can keep typing while receiving messages from other clients, thanks to the separate thread.
Summary:
Server's ClientHandler thread: Handles receiving and broadcasting messages to the clients connected to the server.
Client's thread: The additional thread on the client listens for and processes messages from the server (e.g., messages sent by other users in a chatroom). Without it, the client wouldn't be able to listen for and display incoming messages while simultaneously allowing the user to type and send their own messages.
Both the server and the client need threads to handle concurrent communication, which makes real-time messaging possible.
