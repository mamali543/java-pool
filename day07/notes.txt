Java reflection api helps u to interact and manipulate your classes including their metadata (methods, properties, parameters...).

annotations:
    -@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME):
        this tells that the annotation configuration is not ignored at runtime through reflection, this is the inverse "RetentionPolicy.CLASS"
        and it's the default one, the annotations it's retained by the compiler only at compile time and not available at runtime.
